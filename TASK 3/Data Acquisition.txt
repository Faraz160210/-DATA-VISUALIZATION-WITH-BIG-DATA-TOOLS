Data Acquisition:

>> Assume we have a large CSV file (e.g., large_sales_data.csv).
>> In Power BI Desktop, click "Get Data" and select "Text/CSV."
Browse to the file and import it.
>> If the data is in a database, select the appropriate database connector (e.g., SQL Server, Azure SQL),
>> If the data is in a cloud storage system, select the correct cloud connector (e.g. Azure Blob Storage, AWS S3).
